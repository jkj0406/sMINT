# sMINT: 
We have developed an AI-powered bioanalytical tool for analyzing subtle multicellular perturbations, which has been applied to identify cellular radiation stimulation doses, investigate the origins of metastatic foci, elucidate the challenging clinical states of tumors, and study the characteristics of cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease.
